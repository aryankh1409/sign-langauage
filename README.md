# sign-langauage



Speech impairment is a disability which affects an individual’s ability to communicate using speech and hearing. People who are affected by this use other media of communication such as sign language. Although sign language is quite common in recent times, there remains a challenge for non-sign language speakers to communicate with sign language speakers or signers. With recent advances in deep learning, machine learning and image processing there has been promising progress in the fields of motion and gesture recognition using machine learning techniques. The focus of this project is to provide a means of communication between the signers and the people unfamiliar with sign-language. Given a hand gesture, implementing such an application which detects predefined American sign language (ASL) in a real time through hand gestures and providing facility for the user to be able to store the result of the character detected, also allowing such users to build their customized gesture so that the problems faced by persons who aren’t able to talk vocally can be accommodated with technological assistance and the barrier of expressing can be over shadowed.
 OBJECTIVE
 To recognise sign language.


Software Requirements:
The implementation of Sign Language Recognition must have at least the minimum requirement of the following software:
Front End Requirements:
i. Spyder GUI: open source cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE).
Anaconda Navigator: Anaconda Navigator is a graphical user interface to the conda package and environment manager.
Back End Requirements:
i. OpenCV: because it was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time application.
ii. NumPy: Used for the various scientific calculations and pixel-based computations.
iii. Keras: focus on enabling fast experimentation and allows easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
iv. TensorFlow v1.12+: because it is used to build the Convolutional Neural Network for this project.
